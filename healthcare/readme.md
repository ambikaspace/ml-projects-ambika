# 🩺 Life Expectancy Prediction – Healthcare ML Project

This project focuses on predicting **life expectancy** using key health, demographic, and economic indicators, inspired by real-world healthcare policy analysis.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes factors such as:
- Adult mortality
- Alcohol consumption
- BMI
- GDP
- Schooling
- Healthcare expenditure
- and more...

## 🎯 Objective
Build a regression model to predict the **life expectancy** of a country (like the UK) based on relevant health features.

## ⚙️ Model Used
- Linear Regression  
- Metrics: R² Score, RMSE  
- Visualization: Actual vs Predicted plot

## 📈 Results
- **R² Score:** Around 0.88 (based on cleaned features)
- The model shows strong correlation between schooling, health spending, and life expectancy

## 🧠 Insight
This lightweight ML model demonstrates how healthcare data can support national planning, policy analysis, and social forecasting.
